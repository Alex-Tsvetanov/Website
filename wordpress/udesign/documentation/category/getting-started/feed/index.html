<p>UDesign works with any versions of PHP greater than 5.6+ and MySQL 5.0+, but these versions are already reached out the end of their life cycle.</p>



<p>Using a low version of those maybe expose your site to security vulnerabilities.</p>



<p>We recommend you should follow requirements for your server to use our UDesign.</p>



<ul class="has-text-color" style="color:#222222"><li>Using the latest version of WordPress</li><li>PHP 7.3 or higher</li><li>MySQL 5.6 or higher</li><li>Memory Limit 128M or higher</li><li>HTTPS support.</li></ul>



<h4 class="mt-9 mb-3">Recommended PHP configuration</h4>



<p>Many issues that you may face such as white screen, demo content fails when importing, max execution time error and other similar issues are all related with PHP configuration limit. </p>



<p>To resolve these issues, you need to increase PHP configuration limit. It is easy as ABC, so you can do it by yourself, or ask your web host administrator to increase them.</p>


<div class="alert alert-info mt-5">
<ul class="mt-2 mb-2">
<li class="text-dark">max_memory_limit 512M</li>
<li class="text-dark">max_execution_time 600</li>
<li class="text-dark">max_input_vars 2000</li>
<li class="text-dark">upload_max_file_size 32M</li>
<li class="text-dark">post_max_size 32M</li>
</ul>
</div>



<h4 class="mt-9 pt-2 mb-3">How to verify your PHP configuration limit</h4>



<p>After PHP configuration setup, you can verify PHP configuration limit from the <code class="code-grey">UDesign Dashboard</code> page.</p>

<h4 class="mt-7 mb-3">1. Common Reasons of a Slow Site</h4>



<p>There are several possible reasons for a site to show slow performance, and we are going to share exactly how to speed up your WordPress site.</p>



<ul class="mt-4 mb-3"><li>Choose performance optimized web hosting.</li></ul>



<p>First off, you definitely want a host that offers PHP 7+. PHP 7+ offers massive performance improvements over the old version of PHP 5. We recommend using&nbsp;<a href="http://www.a2hosting.com/refer/98595">A2 Hosting</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Blue Host</strong>&nbsp;for all your hosting needs..</p>



<ul class="mt-4 mb-3"><li>Use Content Delivery Network(CDN)</li></ul>



<p>CDNs(Content Delivery Network) are great to reduce TTFB(theoretically). By offloading bandwidth to their data centers, you’re lightening the load on your server which should improve it’s TTFB.</p>



<ul class="mt-4 mb-3"><li>Clean up your database</li></ul>



<p>A thorough database cleanup can help reduce TTFB in WordPress. You can clean database using WordPress plugin such as<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-optimize"> WP-Optimize</a>. &nbsp;WP-Optimize lets you go through your actual plugin tables and deletes tables left behind by old plugins you previously deleted. </p>



<p class="alert alert-warning mt-4">*Note: Please backup your database before doing this.</p>



<ul class="mt-4 mb-3"><li>Delete unused Themes &amp; Plugins</li></ul>



<p>If you have many installed and activated plugins and themes that are not actually used, they can increase your TTFB.  Please remove themes and plugins that you are not using.</p>



<ul class="mt-4 mb-3"><li>Configure Solid Cache plugin</li></ul>



<p>Using proper cache plugins can help you and your site speed up.  Please read our blog here.</p>



<ul class="mt-4 mb-3"><li>Block unwanted Bots.</li></ul>



<p>Have you checked your Wordfence live traffic report? Please check it and block all of the spam bots hitting your site. Spam bots increase CPU usage of your machine by hitting again and again.</p>



<h4 class="mt-9 mb-3">2. UDesign Speed Optimize Wizard</h4>



<p>UDesign theme offers you a tool to help improving site speed.</p>



<p>You can decrease the size of resources that are loaded in your web page and improve rendering speed by using UDesign Speed Optimization Wizard.
